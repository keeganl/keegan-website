In an attempt to learn more about deformations and explore linear algebra in an applied example. I decided to read some published papers and try to implement the method within similar to the process that I did for <i>Real-Time Shape Deformations</i>. I decided to implement Linear Subspace Design for Real-Time Shape Deformation in libigl.
